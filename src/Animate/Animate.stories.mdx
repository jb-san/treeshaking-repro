# Animate


Our UI animation should enhance and improve usability in a way that the user (almost) don't notice.

It should be subtle but clear in the **intention**:

- Create focus on a certain task (custom select)
- Create focus an certain information (expanding content, modal window)
- Highlight dynamic content (Pricebar)
- Give user feedback (Validation)
- Illustrate or tweak perception of time (Loading bar)

It should be subtle but clear and repetitive in **motion**:

- It should help the user understand how the information flows (vertical/horizontal e.g. steps and accordions)
- It should be cohensive throughout the site and help the user's orientation on the site (repetitive animations and interaction states)
- It should help to make content more alive

It should set our UI-elements in context of Folksam's **brand**:

The company with the big heart (engaged, personal, responsive) needs an UI that feels human (not like today robotic on and off states)




## The `Animate` component

```js
import { Animate } from 'folksam-ui';
```

**<Animate/\>** is the mother component upon which all of the animations reside as subcomponents, eg. `Animate.drop`, `Animate.slideIn` and so on.
In general, the thing that is to be animated is passed as children, like so:

```js
<Animate.drop>
    {shouldBeDropped ? <ChildComponent/> : null}
</Animate.drop>
```

The animations that don't have the same kind of appearing/disappearing behaviour generally require using some kind of `isActive` prop, eg:

```js
<Animate.rotate isActive={shouldRotate} degrees={45} direction={'left'}>
    <ChildComponent />
</Animate.rotate>
```
